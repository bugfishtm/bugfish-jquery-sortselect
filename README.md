# Bugfish Sortselect (jquery selectbox plugin)

## üîç Overview

The "multiselect-sortable" jQuery plugin enhances the functionality of multiple select elements by allowing you to easily sort and manage selected options in a dual list box. This revised version of the plugin now includes a "rid" (Resource Identifier) parameter, which helps in distinguishing between different instances of the script when used on the same webpage. Failure to provide a unique "rid" value for each instance can result in errors or unexpected behavior.

### How to use

Load the necessary jQuery libraries:

	<script src="/path/to/cdn/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="/path/to/cdn/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>

Load the multiselect-sortable plugin's JavaScript and CSS files:

	<script src="assets/js/jquery.multiselect.sortable.js"></script>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/jquery.multiselect.sortable.js.css" />

Add the "multiselectsortable" class to your multiple select element and define pre-selected options using the "selected" attribute. Ensure you provide a unique "rid" value for each instance:
	
	<select name="multiselectsortable" class="multiselectsortable demo multiselectsortable-1" multiple data-rid="instance-1">
	</select>
	 
	<select name="multiselectsortable" class="multiselectsortable demo multiselectsortable-2" multiple data-rid="instance-2">
	</select>

	<select name="multiselectsortable" class="multiselectsortable demo multiselectsortable-3" multiple data-rid="instance-3">
	</select>

Call the function on the select element to activate the plugin, ensuring you pass the "rid" parameter for each instance:

	 jQuery(function($){
	   // Example 1
	   $('.multiselectsortable-1').bugfish_sortselect({
	    rid: 'instance-1'
	   });
	 });
	
	
	 jQuery(function($){
	   // Example 2
	   $('.multiselectsortable-2').bugfish_sortselect({
	    rid: 'instance-2'
	   });
	 });
	
	
	jQuery(function($){
	  // Example 3
	  $('.multiselectsortable-3').bugfish_sortselect({
	   rid: 'instance-3'
	 });
	});
